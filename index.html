            Mycocene is a room sized installation consisting of reanimated electronic waste sculptures and a live cell culture, all occupying a shared dimly lit space. Mycocene uses a juxtaposition of bio-art and electronic (kinetic) sculpture to critique our relation to technology, one that largely ignores the ecological impact technology has on the Earth. Using a mixture of reclaimed electronic waste and the fungal-esque organism slime mold, Mycocene acts as a hybrid between the living and the technological world.<br><br>
            The room of Mycocene contains five electronic waste sculptures all separated but in communication with the slime mold. The slime mold is centered in the room, bathed by a spotlight of green light that emanates to the remainder of the room. The e-waste sculptures, positioned around the cell container are separated by dimly lit, relying on the green glow of the slime mold to outline their components. Each of them are actuated by an electronic pulse modelled off the live growth and movement of the slime mold. The two are intertwined, creating a living atmosphere permeated by the sound of motors spinning, cameras zooming, hard drives spinning. The atmosphere is disharmonious, yet organic. The soundscape solely relies on the physically audible (non-curated) actuations of the sculptures. As they jolt to life, the biological pulses of the slime mold can be heard in the rhythms of the sound echoing through the space. Moving around the dim channels between sculptures, decaying security cameras start to scan, the frame of a human body emerges onto a CRT screen buried under wires. Another pulse triggers a melody punctuated by noise and static, as a magnetic tape crawls along the walls. Surrounded by electronic waste, the singular slime mold culture orchestrates an evolving performance, using the sculptures as its means of communication with the world.

          <p> MULTIPLEXER, 2019</p>

          <div class="subtext" style="margin-bottom:0%;">
            <p> <br>MULTIPLEXER is a speculative performance in which perpetual labor, network processing, and control
              protocols are poetically articulated as elements of a closed thermodynamic system.
              <br><br>
              In this durational piece, the body acts on and is acted upon by its environment. From within a human-scale
              structure—a hybrid between a server farm and a greenhouse—
              the primary action is the performer’s control of the lighting and sound through the use of a custom
              multiplexer panel. Meanwhile, infrared lamps inject heat into the system, acting as concrete metaphors for
              the thermal exhaust generated by intense data computation. In this way, the performance investigates the
              impact of heat on a biomechanical system. This individual, confined, labors endlessly within a network.
              <br><br>
              Changes in the performer’s body state are monitored and mediated in real time. Their heartbeat and body
              temperature have direct effects on the real-time video, projecting images of the body and its sweat onto
              the
              back wall of the structure; quantifying the performer’s exhaustion. Within this arrangement of perpetual
              thermal exchange, the performer’s energy is extracted and injected into the system.

              <br>
              Heat as a medium has theoretical, political, material and environmental implications. In thermodynamics,
              heat reveals the qualitative aspect of molecules energy in matter. But heat is often considered as the
              undesired waste generated by a system. Heat is now controversial. Within this framework, MULTIPLEXER
              establishes a speculative context that challenges human digital behaviors and their collateral effects on
              the biological and geological. Taking place in a fictional future where individuals and machines are
              mutually dependent parts of closed systems, this piece examines the inherent exhaustion of such
              arrangements.

            <p> somme is the interdisciplinary arts collective formed between the artists Sam Bourgault,
              Owen Coolidge, Matthew Halpenny, Matthew Salaciak, and Emma Forgues.
              The collective’s work explores topics such as the systemic relations between nature and technology, surveillance, the invisiblity of network labor, and data politics. somme formed in 2018 as a method of
              combining their collective backgrounds in the sciences (biology & engineering) and the visual
              arts (sculpture, AV work, & performance art). 
  
              somme has exhibited at the ELEKTRA International Digital Art Festival (2019) and
              the International Marketplace for Digital Art (MIAN) (2019) with their bio-art
              installation Mycocene. Mycocene was also  presented at the Centre Pompidou as
              part of the Behavioral Matter conference (March 2019) and selected for the Oboro
              New Media Creation Grant Caisse Desjardins Residency (June 2019). </p>

            <p> Matthew Salaciak (Montreal) is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist. Stemming from a
              curiosity to understand how things work, his interests are aimed at electronics, models of computation and
              their interactions with the physical world. Furthering this, he has recently been interested in the
              relationships between analog and digital interfaces at the software and hardware level. His work as an
              artist and musician is guided by such research questions. His electronic music performances are developed
              solely by the interaction with analog electronics. <br>
