            <p> <br>multiplexer is a speculative performance in which perpetual labor, network processing, and control
              protocols are poetically articulated as elements of a closed thermodynamic system.

              in this durational piece, the body acts on and is acted upon by its environment. from within a human-scale
              structure—a hybrid between a server farm and a greenhouse—
              the primary action is the performer’s control of the lighting and sound through the use of a custom
              multiplexer panel. meanwhile, infrared lamps inject heat into the system, acting as concrete metaphors for
              the thermal exhaust generated by intense data computation. in this way, the performance investigates the
              impact of heat on a biomechanical system. this individual, confined, labors endlessly within a network.

            <p> <br>Sam Bourgault (Montreal) owns a bachelor in Physics Engineering (2015) and one in Computation Arts (2019). Embedding coding, video, sound and electronics, her practice involves constant back and forth between art and science and explores how technology impacts and shape the social and individual experience one has with machines and algorithms. Her work has been exhibited at Ars Electronica Campus Exhibition (Linz, 2018), Mutek Festival (2017), Livart for Nuit Blanche (2019), Art Matters (2018), and the VAV gallery (2018). Bourgault has also performed at RIPA (2019), OFFTA (2019), Induction (2019), VAULT (2018), LIP (2018), Algorave (2018), and InnerEchoes (2018, 2017).
