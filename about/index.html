          <div class="subtext" style="margin-bottom:0%;">
            <p> Somme is a collaborative art practice formed by Sam Bourgault, Owen Coolidge, Matthew Halpenny, Matthew Salaciak, and Emma Forgues in 2018. We naturally began working to- gether after meeting during our degree in Computation Arts at Concordia Universi- ty.
                Our diverse backgrounds and skill sets allow us to merge computer programming,
                electronics, sound synthesis, visual arts, and science to form a transdisci-
                plinary practise.
                Focusing on such aspects as human-technology interactions, media archeology, and
                digital materiality, we employ kinetic installations, interactive experiences,
                and speculative performances to express our thoughts and feelings vis-à-vis our
                technological reality.</p> </div>

            <p> <br>Sam Bourgault (Montreal) owns a bachelor in Physics Engineering (2015) and one in Computation Arts (2019). Embedding coding, video, sound and electronics, her practice involves constant back and forth between art and science and explores how technology impacts and shape the social and individual experience one has with machines and algorithms. Her work has been exhibited at Ars Electronica Campus Exhibition (Linz, 2018), Mutek Festival (2017), Livart for Nuit Blanche (2019), Art Matters (2018), and the VAV gallery (2018). Bourgault has also performed at RIPA (2019), OFFTA (2019), Induction (2019), VAULT (2018), LIP (2018), Algorave (2018), and InnerEchoes (2018, 2017).

                <p>Owen Coolidge is an interdisciplinary artist whose practice includes design, photography, and new media art. Common throughout all his work is the critique of human exceptionalism.  Originally from Los Angeles, he has exhibited at art festivals, galleries, and conferences in Montreal (dis)Connect (2018), CUJAH: Art History Conferences (2018), VAV Gallery (2018), Articule (2018), has received the Milieux Undergraduate Fellowship (2017), and his work has been presented at the Behavioral Matter Conference at the Centre Pompidou (2019). He attends Concordia University and is a research assistant to Chris Salter.<br>

        <div class="subtext" style="margin-bottom:0%;">
          <p> <br>Matthew Halpenny is a cross-disciplinary media artist from Montreal. His work seeks to disrupt conventional boundaries around life, evolution, the body, consciousness, and human expression. Such ideas have been explored through use of the human body as a computational instrument (wearable technology skins), artificial evolution, biological hybrid art, and networked cognition performances. His work is inspired by mathematical patterns within nature (such as random chance within evolution, and the probability mechanics within thought and language), embodied cognition and sense theory, network theory and emergent behavior, cybernetics, and individual ecologies. He is a member of Concordia’s interdisciplinary research institute, Milieux, under the Speculative Life Cluster where he works within Concordia’s Biolab.

              <p> Matthew Salaciak (Montreal) is an electronic musician and interdisciplinary artist. Stemming from a curiosity to understand how things work, his interests are aimed at electronics, models of computation and their interactions with the physical world. Furthering this, he has recently been interested in the relationships between analog and digital interfaces at the software and hardware level. His work as an artist and musician is guided by such research questions. His electronic music performances are developed solely by the interaction with analog electronics.  <br>
